The road goes on and on. Suddenly, you see a peculiar glint in the dirt. Could it be? Yes! It's several golden coins that someone must have lost here! What luck!;gold;small
In the woods, you come upon a well-hidden cave. Inside, you find a chest. Opening it, you find a valuable item.;item;mid
In the fields, you meet farmers beset by beastmen. You are clearly a seasoned adventurer, so the beasts disperse at your sight. Farmers are grateful, and even though they have nothing to pay you back with, you are glad that you were there in time to prevent bloodshed.;exp;small
You come across a peddler - a tired and sweaty but amiable enough fellow - who offers to show you his wares.;shop;small
During your travels you come across a small farm. It's not doing very good, and the owner is in dire need of help. You stay for a few days and do some work for the man. In return, he insists on paying you. A measly sum, to be sure, but you still accept it with grace.;gold;small
There's a wagon on the road. Or rather, the remains of it. Seems like bandits attacked some travelling merchants, scared them away, and took everything valuable. Almost everything. In the wreckage, you find something that bandits overlooked.;item;small
You meet a fellow adventurer who offers you to have a friendly brawl. You accept the challenge, and manage to defeat the fellow - although not with ease. The two of you bid each other farewell and go your separate ways, both a little more experienced than before.;exp;small
You reach a small village and decide to browse the wares at the local shop.;shop;small
Exploring an uncharted cave system, you find a grisly scene: a skeleton lies on the floor with its head bashed open on a particularly sharp and nasty-looking rock. The poor fellow must have tripped and fell, never to get back up again. Near the skeleton you find a purse with some money. You bury the remains and take the gold. Would be a pity to let it go to waste.;gold;small
In a tavern, you meet and old retired adventurer who takes a liking to you. You trade stories over mugs of ale, and when it is time to leave, the old man decides to make you a present.;item;small
For several days now you have been walking through war-torn land. Locals that you meet tell you that a neighbouring duchy invaded with an army of mercenaries, and even brought several godlings with them - fearsome and mighty creatures who usually stay in one place, protecting their haunts and receiving offerings from those who live nearby. You listen to these stories with a mixture of disdain and awe.;exp;small
There's chimney smoke in the distance. It's an old trading post that's run by an equally old, cranky gnome. You decide to see what she has for sale.;shop;small
